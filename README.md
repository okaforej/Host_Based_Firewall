# Host_Based_Firewall
Code Challenge
This directory contains:
1. The firewall_Rule.py file
2. The test file. this contains 16 examples. the first 9 will return False. the remaining 7 will return True

I designed a IP test function instead of using inbuilt python class as it requires installation of IP libraries.
Limitation: the program currently fails in comparing two IP address to get which is greater. i.e IP_address1 <IP_address2


I am interested in working with either of the teams.
